# The Power Gym website

## User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

![Mockup](md_images/mockup.jpg)
Website presents The Power Gym as a fitness club, personal training, classes and nutritions. Users will be able to find interesting content in easy and simple way.

This project is for educational purposes and can not be used as a template for a business use. Main aim is to build responsive website with HTML and CSS only. I will use Bootstrap framework to keep website consent and clear.
